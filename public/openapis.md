TODO: Combination of the following paired with LLM Agent to get a list of services based on your requirements:

- Endpoint to search through any API (that we indexed as having a functional OpenAPI)
- Endpoint to search through APIs we have an oAuth2 app for (admin)
- Endpoint to search through your own previously authenticated APIs

API: From feature specification to openapi specs --> sell API to devin etc.
